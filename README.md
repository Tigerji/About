Hi, Tigerji here, I am currently a PhD student on computer science. I am interested in Spiking Neural Network and currently working on projects on supervised/unsupervised learning in feedforward network. Trying to build biological plausible and explainable learning in SNN. Looking forward to collaborations from mathematics and computational neuroscience.

You can reach me at jiyuehuATgmail.com.
